Some thoughts from me, on me.

## My Job

* I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy.  I want you to:
  * Improve your technical skills
  * Grow your career
  * Enjoy your work,
  * Believe in both our team's and our company's mission.
* Ensure you are properly hooked into the team
  * You have built effective relationships with others on the Team.
* Give you the context you need to do well at Honor.
  * You feel empowered as a leader to figure out what you
    need to do and how you think it should be done and then to get it done.
  * You receive any feedback necessary to properly drive towards your goals
    on the team.
* Also build things :P
  * Like most managers at Honor, I am also responsible for executing on
    technical projects.

## My Team

([From here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F2PWxQ-sKJ1uAlrhU9ULXOVmH-CW6dw_ufMzbFLAWHA/edit#slide=id.g2adb66d006_0_0))
If I describe my ideal for our team and each person on it, it is that we:

* take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny
* have each other’s back
* hold each other accountable
* expect excellence in ourselves and each other
* assume positive intent
* always question, always ask “why?”
* constantly learn
* laugh together

## How I Work

### Communication

* Great slack response time
* Terrible email response time
* I prefer a quick slack message before interrupting me, but slack me anytime!
* I tend to respond to slack messages pretty quick, even if it is to say
  "I'm busy, but will get back to you in a little bit."

### My Schedule

* Start fairly early (at home)
* In office around 10-10:30
* I will do my best not to message you during off hours
  * If I do, feel free to ignore it, unless I indicate it's an emergency.
  * I try my best to temper it with a "(not urgent) indicator"

## You and Your Career

### 1:1's

One-on-ones are your time. I will probably have some things to discuss
with you, but these are your opportunities to let me know how you're
doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel
about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc.
These are for the conversations you might not necessarily have with me
when we're sitting at our desks amongst coworkers. If you'd like to
give me a brief status update on things you're working on, that is
fine with me, but those are generally better-suited to a quick chat
at our desks, or a Slack message.

I encourage you to write down some things you want to chat about ahead
of time, because they can be hard to think of or bring up in the moment.
If you struggle with bringing them up, feel free to send me a vague
agenda ahead of time. If you don't know what to talk about, say so.
We can use that as a topic.

1:1's are meant to be flexible.  If you feel like you would benefit from
meeting more or less often, we can easily change the schedule.

### Feedback

#### Feedback for you

* My job is to ensure you got any feedback I (or others) have.

(Maybe: [3 dimensions of feedback](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/why-wont-you-talk-to-me-f30a01a1994c)?)

(Maybe)
More than any other factor, candid and compassionate feedback is
central to a cohesive high-functioning team

Feedback is best received in the context of psychological safety;
I want you to know, both intellectually and experientially, that my
primary desire is for you to be happy and fulfilled

#### Feedback for me

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you
liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could
do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that
doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not
be the case, I do want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to
hear it, I'd love feedback on why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're
only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack
message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love
for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they
can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.
